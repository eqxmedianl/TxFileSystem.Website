# About TxFileSystem

## Reasoning behind this OpenSource .NET library
While [EQX Media B.V.](https://www.eqx-media.nl "Visit the website of EQX Media B.V.") was developing a cloud application, they were in the need of a proper and extensively implemented library. Enabling them to perform transactional operations on files and directories. That way all data operations could maintain data integrity.

Since no library existed that fullfilled this need, the company owner decide to develop one for the public.

Since the first release it has been published on NuGet.

## Design and Development
The development of this OpenSource .NET library `TxFileSytem` is facilitated by [EQX Media B.V.](https://www.eqx-media.nl "Visit the website of EQX Media B.V.").
A company *Software Development House & Marketing Agency* from The Netherlands.
